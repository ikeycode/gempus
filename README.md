# gempus

This 'project' is initially an implementation of a programming question set
by a recruiter. Given an input file in a simplified crontab format, output
the time-ascending order of events (i.e. execution paths)

I personally thought it had some potential, figured, fuck it, create
a more 'complete' crond in Golang around the notion. More than likely
I'll never complete the project, but hey, I like code.

Oh, and I know, it has literally no real world purpose, and vixie-style
cronds the world unite, systemd ate the crond, etc, etc.

## Name

Perverse merging of `tempus` (Latin: time) with `golang`.

## Authors

What, too cool for `git blame`? OK, Ikey Doherty is to blame for the code.
